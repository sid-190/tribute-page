        <div>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875. He was born to a middle-class
            family and had five siblings. His father’s name was Jhaverbhai Patel, and his mother’s was Ladba. He started
            his early education at Karamsad and Petlad. Apart from the education he received from schools, he was mainly
            self-taught. He was a voracious reader and learnt subjects by borrowing books from his friends. Patel was
            married to Jhaverben Patel, when he was approximately sixteen to seventeen years old. He completed his
            matriculation at the age of 22.

            Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a very strong interest in law. After winning the district pleader’s
            examination, he started practising law. In 1900, he started an independent district pleader office in
            Godhra. After running it for two years, he moved to Borsad and Anand to continue his practice of law.

            After his wife’s unexpected demise in 1909, Patel decided to leave for England to complete his studies in
            law. He moved to London in August 1910 and enrolled at the Middle Temple. Patel enthusiastically completed
            his education with great academic success and returned to India in 1913. After returning to India, Patel
            settled in Ahmedabad and established himself as one of the successful barristers in India.

            Sardar Patel wasn’t a strong political figure till 1917. Meeting Mahatma Gandhi in Godhra fundamentally
            changed the ideology of Patel’s life and made him a true admirer of Gandhian principles. He realised the
            power of ‘Ahimsa’ (non-violence) and believed it was the best political tool to win independence for India
            from British rule. After his meeting with Gandhi, Patel decided to drop his high-earned job and devote
            himself to the freedom movement of India. As an initial step, he changed his style and appearance and
            started wearing white clothes made in India.

            From 1917 onwards, Patel participated in numerous freedom movements. Patel marked his entrance into public
            issues in 1918. He planned a mass campaign against the Bombay government with the participation of peasants,
            farmers, and landowners of Kheda city in Gujarat. The movement was to fight for the exemption of taxes
            because of the crop failures caused by heavy rains.

            Later in 1920, he joined Gandhi’s Non-cooperation Movement, led the Satyagraha Movement in Nagpur in 1923,
            conducted the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928, Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930, Quit India Movement in 1942
            etc. During the Bardoli Satyagraha, Vallabhbhai Patel won the title of ‘Sardar’, and his active
            participation in the campaign made him popular throughout the nation. After 1947, for the first three years
            of Indian independence, he served as the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of
            Information, and Minister of States. Later in 1950, Sardar’s health deteriorated, and India lost one of the
            finest freedom fighters on 15 December, 1950.
